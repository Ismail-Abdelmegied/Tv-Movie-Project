        <p>Courage is the title character and protagonist of the series. An overly frightened pink beagle dog who lives in Nowhere, Kansas, Courage was abandoned as a puppy after his parents were sent into outer space, but was adopted by Muriel Bagge. Her husband Eustace regularly mistreats him. Ironically, given his name, Courage is a genuine coward and he often expresses his distress with over-the-top, piercing shrieks. Regardless, he still goes to great lengths to protect his owners. To the end, he often gets injured, sometimes quite brutally, and only surviving through his determination and/or pure luck. Despite his cowardice, Courage is very clever and resourceful when the situation demands it, outsmarting the villains most of the time. He also often displays super strength, carrying Muriel and Eustace with relative ease. Aiding him at saving the day is a self-aware, sarcastic and seemingly omniscient computer that he keeps in the attic. He got his name when Muriel found him as a puppy alone in an alley and remarked that he must be quite brave to be there by himself</p>

        <p>Muriel Bagge is Courage's owner and Eustace's wife. She is an elderly, overweight, kind, hard-working Scottish woman who took Courage in when he was an abandoned puppy. Muriel often carries a rolling pin that she hits Eustace with whenever he harasses Courage. She also likes tea and usually tends to her garden, as well as being an accomplished sitar player. Muriel also has a great fondness for cooking; however, her recipes tend to include an excessive amount of vinegar, much to the distaste of both her dog and husband. Most of all, she loves sitting in her rocking chair with Courage on her lap and watching television. Due to her kindness and sweet nature, Muriel is an easy (and often attractive) target for villains.</p>

        <p>Eustace Bagge is Muriel's husband. He is an elderly, skinny, jaded, selfish, disgruntled, cynical, cruel, greedy American man who is interested in money and obsessed with his truck. Eustace is also the current owner of the farmhouse, which was previously owned by his now-deceased brother Horst. Eustace regularly mistreats Courage out of jealousy and calls him a "stupid dog". Eustace wears glasses identical in appearance to Muriel's, and his brown hat shields his bald head. Eustace often refers to Courage simply as "Dog" and rarely addresses him by name. He regularly demeans Muriel as well; in one episode, Muriel develops amnesia and Eustace takes advantage of this by simply convincing her that she is a "slave woman", making her do all the chores and cooking around the house. Still, he does love his wife, as evidenced by his concern for her well-being in a few episodes, such as 'The Mask' and "Demon in the Matteress". Eustace is commonly the subject of an unpleasant ending, whether it being a backfire of his get-rich-quick scheme or the villain of the episode going after him, or better yet, getting his comeuppance at the end, often in quite brutal or fatal ways.</p>

        <p>Courage's computer that speaks with an English accent and gives him advice on how to deal with crazy situations. He is very cynical and sarcastic towards Courage and has a habit of regularly cracking jokes in any situation.</p>

        <p>Dr. Vindaloo is an Indian doctor with a thick accent, whom Eustace and Muriel see when something is wrong. He is one of the few characters in the series who can perfectly understand what Courage is trying to say. He diagnoses his patients as not having serious problems or that there is nothing that he can do, but has, on occasion, been a great help, as in "Invisible Muriel", where he managed to discover how to return Muriel to normal.</p>

        <p>Ma Bagge is the mother of Eustace and Horst and Muriel's mother-in-law, who shares a love-hate relationship with the farmer. She also lives in a trailer. She is also the widow of Icket Bagge. Like Eustace she is actually bald but wears a wig and looks almost identical to her son, but much shorter. Like Eustace, Ma is insecure due to being bald, but she does have her teeth. It is learned that Ma and Horst's ill treatment was part of Eustace's negative personality.</p>

        <p>Shirley the Medium is a small green Chihuahua garbed as a stereotypical Gypsy fortune-teller with a Romanian accent who resides in a dilapidated caravan. She has a strong dislike of Eustace (whom she always refers to as "the stupid one") because he is greedy and selfish and she places Eustace under curses a lot to get him to be a better person. Shirley is one of Courage's three confidants, the others being the Computer and Dr. Vindaloo, and helps him occasionally by casting and reciting spells and playing the saxophone in-between verses.</p>
